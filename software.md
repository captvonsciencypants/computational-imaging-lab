## Reborn
The [reborn](https://kirianlab.gitlab.io/reborn/index.html) Python package contains utilities for the simulation and analysis of X-ray diffraction under the Born approximation.

The documentation also contain useful notes on the mathematics and theory associated with X-ray diffraction.

## Reconstruction from projection images affected by Ewald curvature

[Ewald paper](https://gitlab.com/jpchen1/em-reconstruction-with-ewald/)

We published a paper in 2021 detailing an algorithm that is able to reconstruct a 3-dimensional object from 2-dimensional projection images affected by the Ewald sphere [1]. Such an algorithm is useful in cryo-electron microscopy where larger samples, higher resolution, or lower energy electron beams are desired, all of which contribute to the significance of Ewald curvature.

The program is freely available [here](https://gitlab.com/jpchen1/em-reconstruction-with-ewald/) and reproduces all of the figures and results from [1].
