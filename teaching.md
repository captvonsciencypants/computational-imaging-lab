# Teaching

I enjoy teaching, and I am passionate about science education. I believe most of the world's problems can be solved through educating our next generations and inspiring them to discover a better future.
My expertise and interest is in physics and programming and some of the resources I have created can be found in this section.

# Jupyter Notebooks
Some illustratively inventive ipython notebooks are maintained here.
These notebooks were initiated when I was helping to organise the [Prickly Python](http://prickly-pythons.github.io/) meetings at Arizona State University where anyone interested can come along and learn about physics and Python.

## Python basics

## Data processing

## Numerical methods

## Physics

I recorded a series of lecture videos on numerical methods and algorithms for a Python programming course at the University of Canterbury for first year engineering students.

A sample is shown below.

The full series can be found here.

# Teaching and training resources from other people
There are some great resources out there, waiting for people to discover.
I've collection of some of the best resources I've encountered in case others may find it useful too

A nice article outlining many useful tips and strategies for writing good computer codes
