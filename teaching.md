# Teaching

I enjoy teaching, and I am passionate about science education. I believe most of the world's problems can be solved through educating our next generations to create a better future.
My expertise is in physics and programming and some of the resources I have created can be found in this section.

# Jupyter Notebooks
Some of the notebooks from when I helped organised the [Prickly Python](http://prickly-pythons.github.io/) meetings at Arizona State University are maintained here.

## Python basics

## Data processing

## Numerical methods

## Physics


# COSC131 - Introduction to Programming for Engineers
I recorded a series of ten lecture videos on numerical methods and algorithms for a Python programming course for first year engineering students.

A sample is shown below.

The full series can be found here.
