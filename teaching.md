# Teaching

I enjoy teaching, and I am passionate about science education. I believe most of the world's problems can be solved through educating our next generations and inspiring them to discover a better future.
My expertise and interest is in physics and programming and some of the resources I have created can be found in this section.

# Jupyter Notebooks
Some illustratively inventive ipython notebooks are maintained here.
These notebooks were initiated when I was helping to organise the [Prickly Python](http://prickly-pythons.github.io/) meetings at Arizona State University where anyone interested can come along and learn about physics and Python.

## Python basics

## Data processing

## Numerical methods

## Physics

# COSC131 - Introduction to Programming for Engineers
I recorded a series of lecture videos on numerical methods and algorithms for a Python programming course at the University of Canterbury for first year engineering students.

A sample is shown below.

The full series can be found here.
