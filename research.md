## Research

We develop new algorithms and computational methods to process and analyse X-ray diffraction data collected at an X-ray free-electron laser, extracting meaningful information from the data to elucidate the structure of proteins and viruses.

### Shape-transform phasing


### Phasing from crystal defects


### Single particle imaging


### Multi-modal imaging
