# Research

We develop new algorithms and computational methods to process and analyse X-ray diffraction data collected at an X-ray free-electron laser. The goal is to extract meaningful information from the data to elucidate the structure of biological molecules such as proteins and viruses.

## Shape-transform phasing


## Phasing from crystal defects
Intensities between Bragg peaks can also arise from the deviation of a crystal's unit packing from their ideal lattice sites.



## Single particle imaging


## Multi-modal imaging


## Phase retrieval algorithms
One of the main algorithms we use are called "iterative projection algorithms" [1] These are dynamical systems that is able to solve
