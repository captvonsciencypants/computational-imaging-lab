# Research

We develop new algorithms and computational methods to process and analyse X-ray diffraction data collected at an X-ray free-electron laser. The goal is to extract meaningful information from the data to elucidate the structure of biological molecules such as proteins and viruses.

## Shape-transform phasing


## Phasing from crystal defects
Intensities between Bragg peaks can also arise from the deviation of a crystal's unit packing from their ideal lattice sites.



## Single particle imaging


## Multi-modal imaging



## Phase retrieval algorithms
One of the main algorithms we use are called "iterative projection algorithms" [1] These are dynamical systems that is able to find solutions to an inverse problem. Phase retrieval is an example of an inverse problem where the Fourier phases are to be recovered from the Fourier magnitudes.
