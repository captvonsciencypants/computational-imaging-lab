# Welcome

Hello! Welcome to the website for our computational imaging laboratory, thanks for visiting.
<br>
<br>
We work on imaging tiny objects using the computer as a lens. These tiny objects include:
* Proteins
* Viruses
* Nanoparticles
* Microscopic structures

We develop the methods to visualise these objects and collaborate with biologists, chemists, engineers and physicists to achieve our ultimiate goal of helping to cure diseases, engineer a more sustainable future, and increase our understanding of nature herself.

A gallery of images of the things we have been working on is shown below.

The methods we are currently working on to achieve this goal are described on the [research](research.md) page 



We mainly use Python for our work
```python
print('hello world')
```
You can find a collection of resources in the [Teaching](teaching.md) section of this website.



## Funding 
Our work is supported by:
